    "## Numpy\n",
    "NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is one of the most important fundamental packages for numerical computing in Python. Most computational packages providing scientific functionality use NumpPy’s array objects for data exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here are some of the things you will find in NumPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tNdarray, an efficient multidimensional array providing fast array-orientated arithmetic        operations and flexible broadcasting capabilities.\n",
    "2.\tMathematical functions for fast operations and entire arrays of data without having to write loops. \n",
    "3.\tTools for reading /writing array data to disk and working with memory -mapped files.\n",
    "4.\tLinear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities.\n",
    "5.\tA C API for connecting NumPy with libraries written in C, C++, or FORTRAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because NumPy provides an easy-to-use C API, it is straightforward to pass data to external libraries written in low-level language and also for external libraries to return data to Python as NumPy arrays. This feature has made Python a language of choice for wrapping legacy C/C++/Fortran codebases and giving them a dynamic and easy-to-use interface.\n",
    "One of the reasons NumPy is so important for numerical computations in Python is because it is designed for efficiency on large arrays of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### There are a number of reasons for this, as follows:\n",
    "1.\tNumPy internally stores data in a contiguous block of memory, independent of other built-in Pyhton objects. NumPy’s library of algorithms written in the C language can operate on this memory without any type checking or other overhead. NumPy arrays can also use much less memory than built-in Python sequences.\n",
    "2.\tNumPy operations perform complex computations on entire arrays without the need for loops.\n"
