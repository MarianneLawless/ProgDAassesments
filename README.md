### Assignment 2018 
### Start Date 10.10.2018  End Date 11.11.2018
### The programming Language used to assist in writing code for this project is Python
Anaconda download is a great way to install Python and all of the common Python libraries on your computer. I recommend installing version 3.6, 64-bit. https://www.python.org/. 


## Problem Statement##
## The following assignment concerns the **numpy.random** package in Python.##

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
 
First of all, I have created a *Jupyter Notebook* explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at five least of the distributions provided for in the package.

There are four distinct tasks in which I carried out in my *Jupyter Notebook*, as follows
1. An explanation of the overall purpose of the package
2. An explanation of the *Simple random data* and *Premutations* functions
3. An explanation of the use of five *Distributions* functions
4. An explantion of the use of *seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers*
