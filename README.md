# Problem Statement

The following assignment concerns the **numpy.random** package in Python. 
I have created a *Jupyter Notebook* explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least of the distributions provided for in the package.

There are four distinct tasks in which I carried out in my *Jupyter Notebook*, as follows
1. An explanation of the overall purpose of the package
2. An explanation of the *Simple random data* and *Premutations* functions
3. An explanation of the use of five *Distributions* functions
4. An explantion of the use of *seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers*
